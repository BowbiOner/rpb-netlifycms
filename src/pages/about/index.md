### Web Developer that hails from the Emerald Isle.

I have been chopping and changing so much about my web presence and just so afraid to commit. I am finally getting the courage to do my thing.

I am an avid cyclist, who loves a good laugh. I am trying to be more open sharing some of the creative things I have made so check back in if you want to see more :)

Here is a pic of my two wheels and I.
